Notes:

I chose to include most of the fields mentioned in Task 1 in the HTML file.
However, based on my knowledge of the automotive world, I selected specific required fields that are most important when buying a car. These fields will appear with a red asterisk, preceded by a note.

Highlights and explanations about certain fields:

Date fields will appear in the format DD/MM/YYYY.
Numeric fields cannot have negative values.
The Year field will be between 1980 and the current year.
I kept the Description field, which is referred to as "free text" on real websites.
